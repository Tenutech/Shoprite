While these issues do not result in outright failure of the check, they raise questions that cannot be ignored. For instance, there were minor inconsistencies in employment dates or education history that did not match our records. These discrepancies could be due to a variety of reasons, such as clerical errors or miscommunication, and warrant a secondary review.'
